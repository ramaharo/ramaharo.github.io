Madagascar had the opportunity to participate in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) in [2016](https://www.imo-official.org/country_info.aspx?code=MDG){:target="_blank"}, a milestone made possible through the generous support of Collège Lumière International and the Ministry of National Education. Above all, this achievement was largely due to the dedicated efforts of Professor Fanja Rakotondrajao, who served as the key liaison between the IMO and Madagascar. Her profound commitment to promoting mathematical culture in the country played an instrumental role in making this participation a reality.
