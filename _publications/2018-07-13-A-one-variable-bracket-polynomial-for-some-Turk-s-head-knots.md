We compute the Kauffman bracket polynomial of the three-lead Turk's head, the chain sinnet and the figure-eight chain shadow diagrams. Each of these knots can in fact be constructed by repeatedly concatenating the same 3-tangle, respectively, then taking the closure. The bracket is then evaluated by expressing the state diagrams of the concerned 3-tangle by means of the Kauffman monoid diagram's elements.
