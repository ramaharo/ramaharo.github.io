We give the connection between three polynomials that generate triangles in The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ([A123192](https://oeis.org/A123192), [A137396](https://oeis.org/A137396) and [A300453](https://oeis.org/A300453)). We show that they are related with the bracket polynomial for the (2,n)-torus knot.
