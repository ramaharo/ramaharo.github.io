We carry out principal component regression analysis on a dataset consisting of selected relevant economic and energy indicators in order to identify the main driving factors impacting the electricity consumption in Madagascar. Our results show that in accordance with the country's current energy profile, factors related with rural electrification have the most influence on electricity consumption in Madagascar.
