We enumerate the state diagrams of the twist knot shadow which consist of the disjoint union of two trivial knots. The result coincides with the maximal number of regions into which the plane is divided by a given number of circles. We then establish a bijection between the state enumeration and this particular partition of the plane by means of binary words.
