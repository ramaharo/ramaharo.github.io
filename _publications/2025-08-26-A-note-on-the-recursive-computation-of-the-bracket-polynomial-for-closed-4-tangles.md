Given a 4-tangle shadow, we concatenate it with itself n times and form a knot by applying a closure operation that connects each top endpoint to the corresponding bottom endpoint on the same side without introducing any crossings. We then compute the Kauffman bracket polynomial for the resulting knot using a states matrix defined with respect to the basis of the Kauffman 4-strand diagram monoid.
