Today, I have decided to breathe new life into my old [blog](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} by sharing some origami models from my collection. Though I haven’t folded anything new recently (time is limited these days), I have managed to recover  one or two photos of models I created years ago.

My journey with this blog began around February 2014, a period that coincides with a significant period in my academic life. During that time, Professor Fanja Rakotondrajao and I were collaborating on writing a mathematics textbook in the Malagasy language. We were focusing on the geometry section when we coined the term *Tampaha*  to describe fractals, a word that beautifully captures their essence in our native tongue.  It was during this period that I created the models featured in my first post: a [Level 2 Menger Sponge and a Level 2 Mosely Snowflake Sponge](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/level-2-business-cards-fractal/){:target="_blank"}. The [Level 3 versions](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/project-type/tampaha-project/){:target="_blank"} of these models were built and displayed to the public months later.

Up until now, my last post was on August 8, 2021 August 8, 2021, during my time as a student at the University of La Réunion. Having just graduated, I wanted to celebrate by combining two passions: my research interests in combinatorial topology and my love for modular origami. For that occasion, I used the [Snapology](https://web.archive.org/web/20170129152118/http://www.origami.friko.pl/snapologia/instrukcja/snapologia.php){:target="_blank"} technique and folded a [Snapology Truncated Octahedron](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/2021/08/08/truncated-octahedron/){:target="_blank"} using paper strips from my notes on combinatorial topology.

As of now, my latest post features a [Dodecahedron](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/2025/03/22/tomoko-fuse-dodecahedron/){:target="_blank"} made using Tomoko Fuse's units. The instructions can be found on page 57 of Tomoko Fuse's book, *Unit Origami Wonderland*.
