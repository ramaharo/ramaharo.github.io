I am an Economist at the Directorate of Studies and Program in the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Madagascar. My work focuses mainly on macroeconomic modeling and forecasting. As part of my professional development, I successfully completed a Master in Advanced Studies in Development Economics in 2025 in the picturesque city of Clermont-Ferrand, France. Thanks to the [Joint Japan/World Bank Graduate Scholarship Program](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/scholarships/jj-wbgsp) (JJ/WBGSP), of which I am now a proud alumnus, I was enrolled in the Master in Economic Policy Management ([Gestion de la Politique Économique](https://economie.uca.fr/formation/master/master-economie-du-developpement-parc-gestion-de-la-politique-economique-3){:target="_blank"}), a program jointly offered since 2003 by the University of Clermont-Auvergne and the Foundation for Studies and Research on International Development  ([FERDI](https://ferdi.fr/){:target="_blank"}). 

I am proud to be a graduate in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Antananarivo, as well as in Mathematics from the University of La Réunion, the latter thanks to the [HORIZON excellence scholarship](https://www.madagascar.campusfrance.org/les-bourses-destinees-aux-etudiantes-et-etudiants-internationaux-en-france).

I was fortunate to be mentored by the late Professor Germain Randriambelosoa, who supervised my master's thesis in Computer-Aided Geometric Design. I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor [Fanja Rakotondrajao](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fanja-Rakotondrajao){:target="_blank"} on several projects, including our Origami Fractal Project ([here](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/portfolio/mosely-snowflake-sponge-fractal-project/){:target="_blank"} and [here](https://ramaharo.wordpress.com/portfolio/level-3-menger-sponge-project/){:target="_blank"}). On that occasion, we jointly coined the beautiful term "[_Tampaha_](https://mg.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tampaha){:target="_blank"}", the Malagasy word for fractal. Her guidance and influence sparked my interest in Enumerative Combinatorics, motivating me to contribute several [integer sequences](https://oeis.org/search?q=author%3AFranck+Maminirina+Ramaharo&go=Search){:target="_blank"} to the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences ([OEIS](https://oeis.org/){:target="_blank"}). In 2021, I was mentored by Professor [Youssef Boudabbous](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Youssef-Boudabbous){:target="_blank"}, who introduced me to the fascinating field of the Reconstruction Problem. These experiences were incredibly enriching, and I cherish every moment of my journey in mathematics. I hope one day to return to academia and continue pursuing research in this captivating discipline. 
 
My [Erd&#337;s number](https://zbmath.org/collaboration-distance/?a=ramaharo.franck&b=erdos.paul){:target="_blank"} is **5**.
 
Research interests
======
I am interested in **macroeconomic modeling**. In Madagascar, simple macroeconomic models often face criticism for allegedly failing to capture the unique intricacies of the Malagasy economy. However, conducting complex modeling is challenging due to the limited availability of data. I have a particular affinity for (quasi-)accounting models, such as the IMF's **Financial Programming** approach or the World Bank's **Revised Minimum Standard Model (RMSM)**, which I find both practical and insightful. 

Additionally, in response to the energy crisis facing our country, I have recently developed an interest in **integrated assessment modeling** as a means to address these pressing challenges. My approach would be at the intersection or combination of **input-output modeling**, **stock-flow consistent (SFC) modeling**, and **system dynamics**, should I have the opportunity to engage in this work.

I believe in **Open Science**.
